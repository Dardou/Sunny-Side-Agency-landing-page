## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a lot about css grids, and I got the chance to make some pretty huge mistakes in my html markup and css design, allowing me to better understand how I should markup my html and use my css for the next project. (Like using vh and vw for margins I realised that if you make it too long the thing is a mess but.. I'll fix it for the next project and not repeat the mistake)

### Continued development

Obviously I'd like to improve on using images as background and keeping a ratio that isn't horrible.
Moreover, I now know not to use vh and vw in places they shouldn't be used
I'm pretty happy about the way I got my flexboxes going though, I did some practice before this project and I felt it while using flexboxes so yay

### Useful resources

- [FlexBox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) - A great interactive way to master flexboxes, kinda got addicted to this type of learning because of it
